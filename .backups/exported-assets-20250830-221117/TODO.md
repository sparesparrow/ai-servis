# TODO

## Android App Build

- [x] Verify gradle wrapper exists and is executable
- [x] Build debug APK locally
- [x] Build release APK locally
- [x] Create Android build Dockerfile with JDK21 and SDK tools
- [x] Add helper script to build image and run assembleDebug
- [x] Build the image and test assembleDebug run
  - ‚úÖ Docker image builds successfully
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation warning about legacy builder (global Docker config)
  - üîÑ Build process was interrupted - need to complete APK generation

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the APK build**: Run the build script again to finish generating the debug APK
2. **Verify APK output**: Check `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
3. **Optional**: Address Docker deprecation warning by enabling BuildKit globally

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build Android APK using Docker
bash android/tools/build-in-docker.sh

# Check for generated APK
ls -la android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
```
